Turning bugs into features since 1876. (this is my second life)

Random (maybe dystopian) ideas no one asked for:
1. Call an Uber but for fixing merge conflicts
2. ratemyprofessor but for roommates
3. Plastic legs that fold into the phone case, so that when you call your device it starts walking towards you
4. A pressure cooker that shows on a display screen if the food is cooked, how long the steam is going to blow for, and when the pressure will be gone
5. Bluetooth charging for all devices in an ecosystem
6. An alarm clock app that makes you do random things to get out of bed (example, burn # calories to stop the alarm, take a picture of yourself doing a crazy pose)
7. Instagram but for studying
8. Scary content trigger warning addon
9. Multiplayer monopoly deal online game
10. Watch app that tells you to take meds after detecting food in system and time of day
11. Realtime language translation for Instagram live
12. Cow shoulder hump for humans so we can meal prep, eat it, store it in the hump, and save refrigerator bill
13. Adrenaline bank to take loans during hackathons
