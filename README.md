Turning bugs into features since 1876. (this is my second life)

Random (maybe dystopian) ideas no one asked for:
1. Call an Uber but for fixing merge conflicts
2. Adrenaline bank to take loans during hackathons
3. ratemyprofessor but for roommates
4. Legs that fold into the phone case, so that when you call your device it starts walking towards you
5. A pressure cooker that shows on a display screen if the food is cooked, how long the steam is going to blow for, and when the pressure will be gone
6. Cow shoulder hump for humans so we can meal prep, eat it, store it in the hump, and save refrigerator bill
